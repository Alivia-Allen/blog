My name is Alivia Allen 
I am a sophomore at Hendrix College who: 
1. loves sports
2. enjoys watching tv shows and movies
3. loves listening to music. 


I'm planning on double majoring in **Computer Science and Spanish**, and hope to have a good year at Hendrix this year. I am apart of *many* different clubs at school and a member of the Track and Field team. Thank you for visiting my blog.
