##Setting Up The Lab {#setting-up}
I struggled with this lab because I didn't follow the directions as I should have. However, once I sat down and devoted time to this lab I was able to make some progress. This lab required me to install a lot of programs on my computer and as a result of not reading the directions I mistakenly thought that one of the programs that I had to install took multiple hours to install. Come to find out that it was my own error.
