# My Experience With Lab 7

## What were the easiest parts of the tutorial?
The easiest part of this tutorial was creating the application and seeding the database. Those are two steps that I had to do over and over just to complete the lab because of error that I would get later in the lab. However after restarting multiple times I found these parts of the lab to become the easiest.

## What were confusing parts of the tutorial? What was difficult to translate when creating your own application in Step 2?
The most confusing parts of the tutorial for me were fixing the error I would get from the smallest mistakes. I had some trouble creating my own application in set 2 because of error and it cause me to have to restart multiple times. However, after restarting multiple times, I became familiar with the steps and was able to fix my errors.

## What parallels and differences do you see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework?
Both frameworks have a default layout template that is pretty easy to use.

## How confident do you feel making another Razor application?
I feel like if I were to make another Razor application that I could handle it but,
I would definitely need to refer back to the tutorial.
