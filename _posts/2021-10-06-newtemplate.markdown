# My reflection on this lab

This lab was difficult for me because I was stuck on one step for a long time. I struggled the most with adding a link to the CSCI 340 homepage, just for there to be a simple solution and after asking for help I learned today that I should've been using my local file instead of [github](https://github.com) to edit my blog.

I learned about jekyll minima and how it worked and I learned about editing/overriding a jekyll theme from this [website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults). Jekyll and Markdown are two totally new things for me and it has been fun to learn about them. It was cool to learn how to create a blog and edit it to my liking. As of right now I think everything makes since to me and I'm looking forward to making more changes to this blog.
