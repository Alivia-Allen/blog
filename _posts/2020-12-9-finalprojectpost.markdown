### Final Project Post

# What skills and talents are most valuable in carrying out the social change work you are doing with your community partner? How well do those skills mesh with the talents or limitations you have come to see in yourself through the experience?

I think time management and teamwork skill are the most valuable. These skill are important because you are working with a group of people and if you can't work well with those people you may not be able to make progress. As for time management there is a deadline that you are working towards, if you don't use your time wisely then you won't make as much progress. For this project I was able to use some of my team work skills and some of my time management skills. Working with my group was great, we communicated on what we needed to get done and what we wanted the finished product to look like. We set times to meet so we could work together or discuss things regarding the project. Sometimes I am not the best at time management, but working with a group caused me to have to work on that skill and improve.

# Consider the social, environmental, or spiritual need on which you are focusing for this Odyssey project. Do you feel that the approaches to creating social change employed by your community partner are effective ways of creating change in this area? Why or why not?

Porch Swing Farms is a small rural farm that cares about the animals that they raise, and about the products they put out. They provide eggs, pork, and other products to their customers and their community. They take great care of their animals and you can tell that they really care about them, they also hold brunches and farm days for the community. I believe that they are making great environmental and social change within their community through their farm. I think that Porch Swing Farms does a great job at what they do so in turn they are effective in creating change.

# Have any of your fundamental values, social ideals, or significant beliefs been challenged or confirmed through this experience? Have you found any of your academic coursework helpful in understanding what you have observed and experienced? Anything you learned in class that you would directly challenge now that you have had this experience?

I have always belied that public outreach as an effective was to promote social change, and to be able to work with a partner who also believes in that was really refreshing. This project was a great way to help out some great people who are doing great things. The labs that we completed in class were beneficial in helping complete the project. It taught us necessary skills that we ended up using to create our site for Porch Swing Farms.

# There are many social, political, environmental, or community issues on which you might work in the years ahead. How has this experience reshaped your views on the public issues that call you to action?

This project gave me insight on working with a client on a project. It was a fun experience and I hope to work on projects for clients again. I learned many valuable lesson on how to maximize my time and how to conduct myself while working with a client. This experience has showed me that I can work with a client, care about the project, and be proficient.
