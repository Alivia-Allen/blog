### 3rd Client Meeting

## What is your continued role in your team project so far and how it has evolved, your contribution to preparation and execution of the third client meeting? What are your future plans to assist your team in completing this project?

My role is still to work on the APIs for the project. We have discovered that we will not be able to use the WIX API or the Optimoroute API and are now trying to find a different way to generate routes within out site. My plan is still to find a way to get information from WIX into our site and generate routes form the site.
