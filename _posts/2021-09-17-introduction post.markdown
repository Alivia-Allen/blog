# My Experience With Lab 3


By Alivia Allen 


## Setting Up The Lab 


I struggled with this lab because I didn't follow the directions as I should have. However, once I sat down and devoted time to this lab I was able to make some progress. This lab required me to install a lot of programs on my computer and as a result of not reading the directions I mistakenly thought that one of the programs that I had to install took multiple hours to install. Come to find out that it was my own error. Majority of the programs that I had to download were new to me. 

## At First I Was Very Confused


I've never used a lot of these programs before and in my opinion it was very evident. I still am very unfamiliar with some of the programs we are using. For example, as I am typing this my Markdown isn't working so I will have to research how to fix it and I don't understand GItKraken and the staging changes aspect. I just figured out how to get Markdown to work and its because of [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#bold) that was provided on the lab page. [This website](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/keyboard-shortcuts/#staging) helped me figure out some aspects of GitKraken but I will still need to practice or just play around with GitKraken to understand it.  I suspect that I may have caused some problems in GitKraken by chaning some setting, but I will figure that out later. 

### Things I'm looking forward to with this blog:
- making more blog posts
- learning more about markdown
- being able to possibly change the design

**I apologize if any grammar is incorrect as I type this my words are appearing on the screen significantly later so I will fix grammar later**
