### What is your personal role in your team project so far, your contribution to the second client meeting, and your future plans to assist your team in completing this project?
My role will be to work on the API for the project. I will try to get data from WIX and into our site. Our hopes are to cut out Optimoroute completely and solely use our site to generate routes for deliveries.
