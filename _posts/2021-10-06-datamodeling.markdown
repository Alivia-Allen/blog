# My Experience With Lab 5
While completing this lab, I assumed that the owner would be an entity in the
shcema and the entity relationship. I also assumed that items would have a
relationship that was one to many or 0 with order instead of many or 0 to 1.
I also ended up having a lot of difficulty inserting images into my blog pages.

Here is my Entity Relationship Diagram

Here is my Schema
